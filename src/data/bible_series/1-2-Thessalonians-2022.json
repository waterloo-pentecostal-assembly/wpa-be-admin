When the apostle Paul was writing his letter to the Christians  in the church at Thessalonica, he didn’t want them stumbling around in the dark about some really important things that were going to happen in the future. The most important thing he wanted them to know was that Jesus is coming back to earth again to take those who believe in him to Heaven.",

That is why we need to tell everyone how they can have their sins forgiven and be ready to meet Jesus when he comes.",

I believed that we should just put our trust in God to handle all of these matters and that if we are children of God, we do not need to fear.  This is what Paul teaches us in 2 Thessalonians.",

Instead it should cause joy since we will experience God’s glory (vs 14).  This is a great reminder for us as well. Let’s have hope about the future, stand firm and not be afraid!

Sometimes we even spend more energy defending our laziness than had we just done the chore! Maybe we don’t want to do it because we don’t know how or its inconvenient or we’ve procrastinated. But whatever the reason, we can feel tempted to be lazy. We mow the lawn, kind of. Or we clean up our room by shoving it all in the closet. But the problem is that when we do this, we actually end up making more work for us or someone else later.",
            "God honours hard work, and he also asks us to rest. What he doesn’t do is allow us to be lazy. When we work hard, we tell God and others that they matter. When we get lazy, we tell God and others that we matter more.",

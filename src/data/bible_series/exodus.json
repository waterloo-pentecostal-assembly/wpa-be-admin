Now You have entered into the true heavenly sanctuary, but You desire that Your presence dwell among us so that You can have fellowship with us. The Bible says that “[our] bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you” (1 Corinthians 6:19). Help me to glorify You, Father, in my body and in my spirit, which belong to You. Lord, You have written Your laws in my heart. I am salt and light in the world. I am the righteousness of God in Christ. Grant me grace to daily live out these truths. Help me to spend time in Your presence so I can develop a more intimate relationship with You. In Jesus’ name.\nAmen."

                                "27": "Then he said to them, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘Each man strap a sword to his side. Go back and forth through the camp from one end to the other, each killing his brother and friend and neighbor.’”",

                                "32": "But now, please forgive their sin—but if not, then blot me out of the book you have written.”",

Thank you Father for entrusting us with talents, skills and special abilities in such great abundance. The Israelites willingly gave of the best of their substance and talents, more than enough to build the tabernacle. May I be a cheerful, generous giver, not in order to receive in return, but to do the work of the ministry, to bless others and to glorify God who gave us the best gift of all, Jesus Christ. I surrender back to You every gift. O Lord, take it and use it for Your glory. In Jesus’ name.\nAmen."

Thank You, Father, that Your Holy Spirit dwells with us, in us and abides forever (John 14:16,17). It’s interesting that the glory of God filled the tabernacle only after Moses completed, anointed and sanctified everything according to God’s commands. Lord, may I maintain a holy sanctuary for Your Presence to dwell. Fill me afresh with Your Spirit. Lead me and guide me. You are with me regardless of the circumstances that I face. Thank you for this hope, comfort and encouragement in these turbulent times.\nAmen."

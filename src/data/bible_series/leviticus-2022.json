Living in the world can allow sin, unintentionally and perhaps even intentionally, to come into my life. Your Word speaks of individual sin, corporate sin and even sins in leadership. I ask you to broaden my understanding of what sin is, that I don’t just pray for me and mine, but that I truly become an intercessor. Holy God, I long to walk in holiness to please you, so that I do not bring harm to myself, my loved ones, my world and my community. I need your help and strength. Thank you that as I confess my sins, you who are faithful and just, will forgive my sins and cleanse me from all unrighteousness. Forgive me, Lord, for my sins and cleanse me, so that I can walk in wholeness and purity before you and the world in which I live. May my life be a fragrant and pleasing offering before you today. Amen."
